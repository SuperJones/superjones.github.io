      <p>
        I am a Web Developer. If I'm not moving, growing, and learning, then I make it my mission to find a way to do so. Ones comfort zone is peaceful and familiar, but where is the fun in that?
        <br>
        I find passions in the places that have shaped who I am and have changed those around me. In short, I have a soft spot for women and children issues and I get excited by programming. I'm eager to be able to create the web solutions that inspire, educate, and empower people.
